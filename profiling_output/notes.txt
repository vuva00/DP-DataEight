1. User Credits Analysis
    Summary analysis:
        N. of observations = 89911
        Missing cells = 46199
        ! Missing cells (%) = 8.6% - THIS NUMBER DOESNT MAKES SENSE. SHOULD NOT IT BE: (N. of observations)/(Missing cells)?

    Variables:
        user - There are no problem in my opinion. There are just users that appears frequent (stud56329, stud66006, stud87878) that could be good to analyse
                - ! If this varaible is fully distinct how can there be a bigger value in the chart?
        redits - problem:
                - a lot of zeros (close to 50% of the whole dataset): could be porblematic in the model - bias
                - there are 5 negative numbers - How can there be negative credits?
        is_active - how do you define "active" user
        is_verfied - how to define "verified" user
        is_locked - what does this mean?
        wage - categorical variable and based on the categories we assume that this is where users want to withdraw credits.
                - A lot of missing!!!
    
    Correlation - high Correlation between is_active and is_verfied

    ! there are few more issues that package identifies (such as skewed data) - view "Alerts" page in the report.

2. Payments Analysis
    Summary analysis:
        N. of observations = 30087
        Missing cells = 5024
        missing cells (%) = 2.1% - I still dont understand how did we get to this number

    Variables:
        id  - there is one missing value!!!
            - starts from number 30 (minor obstacle)
        created_at - there is 1 not distict observation. Why?
        changed_at - no issue
        user - there are a lot of missing observations
        batch
            - what does this varaible says?
            - some missing values
        credits
            - there is one missing observation (might be connected to the missing ID)
            - large amount of Zeros! - how can be zero in payment? Minimum withdraw amount should be 500
        state - in what state in the payment - PAID, CANCELLED, REQUEST, APPROVED
            - one missing! (might be connected to the missing ID)
            - uneven distributed in categories - might be an issues while modeling
        type - where is payment paid to - same as "wage" in the user credits but in english
            - one missing value

    Correlation: small correletaions between state/type, state/id and credits/id - wherever "id" take place we assume that it is random correlation

3. Atlas Cechu Analysis
    Summary analysis:
        N. of observations = 43533
        Missing cells = 0
        missing cells (%) = 0%
    
    Variables:
        this has so many dummy variables. There is no way for me to write out all of them
