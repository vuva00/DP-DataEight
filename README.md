**Project Overview**

This project is built using Python 3.9 due to the compatibility requirements of the `ydata-profiling` package. Unfortunately, this means we cannot upgrade to newer versions of Python at this time.

**Code Organization**

All work-in-progress (WIP) or testing code is located in the `sandbox` file. It is essential to maintain the existing structure to ensure easy navigation and collaboration within the project.
